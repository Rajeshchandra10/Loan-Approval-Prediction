# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive machine learning workflow to predict the approval status of loan applications. By leveraging a variety of machine learning models and robust data preprocessing techniques, it addresses a real-world classification problem. The goal is to build and evaluate models that can accurately determine whether a loan should be approved based on key applicant and financial data.
